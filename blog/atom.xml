        <content type="html" xml:base="https://foxinwinter.github.io/blog/welcome-to-my-website/">&lt;p&gt;Hi! Hopefully you are all doing well today, I know I am!&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&quot;little-tid-bit-of-info&quot;&gt;Little tid-bit of info:&lt;&#x2F;h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;These blogs probably won’t come out every 15 seconds or anything, I’m not used to the whole “Blogging” thing quite yet, and until then these will be infreqent at best, never at worst&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&quot;website-troubles&quot;&gt;Website Troubles&lt;&#x2F;h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Funny story, so I tried this whole thing about 4 hours ago completly un-caffinated and I got almost nowhere, about 2 hours ago I drank a Monster and now most of the website is at a state I am happy with.
Other than that modifing this theme has honestly been a breeze, other than a few hiccups here and there everything just kinda works as it should, I was also expecting Github Pages to freak out with the whole API thing but nope, not a single problem (other than the fact that there isnt a hole in my wall)&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&quot;other-projects&quot;&gt;Other Projects&lt;&#x2F;h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I have also recently started to get into the PS5 jailbreaking scene, I am currently working on finding a kernel exploit for firmware 12.40 (wish me luck). Other than that I have also continued to update my personal install scripts, maybe one day when I have the care to I’ll make them be able to be run on other peoples systems (thats you!)&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&quot;end&quot;&gt;End&lt;&#x2F;h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Okay that’s about all I got for the time being, maybe one day I’ll add a section in the website that displays what app im currently in and whatnot, but thats a problem for future me.
Take care all! Peace out!&lt;&#x2F;p&gt;
