    Dialogue:
        Game1234 (assumed):
        this is for jimmy
        shedleky knew lol (maybe from game1234, unsure)
        thx 4 all the happy memories :D

    Video:
        Glitchy footage of a roblox player on a dance floor with music playing in the background that skips every now and then
        Footage slowly glitches out more and more until it becomes monochrome (Black + White)
        Strange Figure Appears on Screen, unable to tell what it is, however the blockyness of the arms MIGHT point out that it's a roblox character.
        thx 4 happy memories appears on screen again and glitches around the screen
        The final frame has no music, it seems to be two roblox players next to eachother with something directly infront of them, appears to say either: .izo .izxo .izx2 .iz2 or izo or any combo of the before but without periods
        There is also a wall off in the distance with a checkered pattern.

    Video:
        First 9 seconds is a flash of a bunch of old Roblox Avatars with music playing
        After 0:10 the video starts to glitch and freak out
        At Exactly 0:11 there is some sort of dots and lines, unsure the meaning (https://imgur.com/a/wBPujjI)
        At 0:14 the video starts with the text "welcome to a game1234 production"
        At 0:17 a strange sound starts and text appears
            Text:
                "jimmy dont watch"
        At 0:28 text appears at top replacing the simplescreencapture! text
            Text:
                "jimjam5556-jb20vYS9kTFdHeFRv"
        At 0:36 the video blanks and text appears replacing the simplescreencapture! text
            Text: no capture detected
        At the same time a hollow cross appears in the bottom left with an image in it, need to brighten image to see NOTE: No matter what I did, nothing appeared in the cross, I tried every combo of stuff I could thing of but nothing | STATE: MAYBE DEAD END
        That "no capture detected" text blinks in and out a couple of times as well as the hollow cross, image might change
        At 0:43 the same music that played in the intro plays again with a bunch of old Roblox Avatars again
        At 0:51 Text Appears
            Text:
                "A GAME1234 SHORT MOVIE"
        At 0:53 the Previous text disappears and new text appears
            Text:
                "thx for watching :D"
        At the very end of the video the "thx for watching" txt disappears and new text appears

    Puzzles:
        1. Enter the basement and enter the Big Basement Door Code into the icons around the Big Basement Doors

        2. NEED 4 PEOPLE, go to catacombs, Look  keep straight, until you reach a wall then right, keep straight, you will find a hole in the wall, walk through it, then have 1 person stand on
           each platform (around the edges) you will be teleported to Terrrace
            Notes: If the Hole in the Wall is not present then do Puzzle 2a. then continue Puzzle 2.
        2a. Look around at the ceiling of one of the catacombs hallways for a button, if you find it, click it, then continue with Puzzle #1

        3. In Catacombs Keep Straight until you reach a wall, then right, after you turn right keep straight, then at the end of that hallway turn right, you will see an expanse of void, jump into it click the button found on one of the sides of the stone orb
        4. From Dreamgate Facilities the red button, enter the elevator, click the red button to start ascent, reach the top of the elevator shaft, and click the doorknob on the door
            Notes: Vault door code is 7113

        5. Facing the house (from the front), walk to the hill behind you and to the right, when you are approching just walk normally from it, when you are close enough, hug the side of the
           hill (you will die if u dont), then when you see a door walk towards it and click the doorknob
        6. When you are inside of sleepy.time-1 just wait awhile, you will soon be put into upload.time-1
        7. From inside of upload.time-1 input the color combo: Pink, Red, Blue, Green
           when the black text pops on the top of your screen enter something like "1234", as I know that is the incorrect PROCESS_KEY # I am unsure what the correct PROCESS_KEY could be though

        8. Go to the Catacombs, Take the first right, walk up to the light and click it.
        9. When in datamodel, jump off the tower into the void to end up in Kob
        10. From Kob, walk straight to the right until you reach the corner, by the corner you will find a differently textured peice of metal, stand on it until it breaks
            Notes: Falling into the Sludge will kill you! Unsure what to do (if anything) from here


    Notes:
        Catacombs, do NOT touch the black stuff on the walls, you WILL die.
        If you walk completely straight in Kob, there is a bridge of sorts, you WILL die from the fall though, so maybe rappel down the side???

## NOTES:
    Z appears to go by "Lain" as said in the PC in Dreamgate Co., however this appears to have been edited as "Lain" is on a gray background while the rest is white, and it also confirms that Z or "Lain" is indeed the Director
    It is possible that video #3 represents a puzzle in the Terrace, however this is a very far strech, I say this because in the spectrogram it says "turn back" 4x, and there isn't a whole lot in the terrace.
    Jimmy + Game1234 are both Vessels, Z is the (who I think) founded DreamGate, just thanks to the website + their name popping up everywhere.
    In video 4 it mentions 'hunters,' we haven't heard this anywhere else, it is possible, that we the player are the hunters sent out to find Jimmy + Game1234 and help them kill a core.

## TODO:
    Scan the first Imgur Image for anything hidden
    Continue Hunting for Secrets in Game1234's place
    Re-comb over the youtube videos for anything hidden
    Figure Out Puzzle in upload-time-1 > Could be Pink, Red, Green, Blue. From the Big Basement Door code
    Figure Out Puzzle in Kob, some weird metal cube + chain tree or something
    Figure Out what the "Key" is, also the door in the top floor of the house in Game1234's Place
    Get to the top of the elevator in Dreamgate Facilities
